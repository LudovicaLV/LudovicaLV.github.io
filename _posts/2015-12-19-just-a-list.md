I finally figured out how to use [KaTex](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX) last night and posted a something on the gradient of logistic regression to test things out.
So now I've decided to maintain this list of mathematical words/jargons that I come across quite frequently in my field and everytime have to check wikipedia to refresh my memory. I hope this will make it easier for me to remember them. 

**Subadditive:**
A subadditive function is a function $$f:A \rightarrow B$$ , having a domain A and an ordered codomain B that are both closed under addition, with the following property. For all $$ \forall x,y \in A, f(x+y) \leq f(x) + f(y) $$

**Submodular:**
Let $$n$$ be a finite ground set and $$f:2^{N} \rightarrow \R$$. Then $$f$$ is submodular if $$\forall A,B \subseteq N$$,

$$f(A) + f(B) \geq f(A \cup B) + f(A \cap B)


**Hamming Distance:**
In information theory, the Hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different
