### Numerus Model Builder (NMB) models <br />

To generate the data used in Section 4, we defined and run the following NMB models, explained in details in our [SOF](https://ludovicalv.github.io/PDFs/Elep_paper.pdf). 

- The distance-dependent behaviour model can be downloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6g723g5eb801n0x/Model_distance.nmd?dl=1).

- The time-dependent behaviour model can be downloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/x7c8mj63m64jf57/Model_time.nmd?dl=1).

### Simulated data: NMB output <br />

- The output of a simulation of the distance-dependent behaviour model can be downloaded [for individual A](https://www.dropbox.com/s/augv0snaw7kiefj/ModelDistance_A.csv?dl=1) and [for individual B](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3mepynoz3mgwrjr/ModelDistance_B.csv?dl=1).

- The output of a simulation of the time-dependent behaviour model can be downloaded [for individual A](https://www.dropbox.com/s/k8x465e6mwq3xs6/ModelTime_A.csv?dl=1) and [for individual B](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ysfpferyop5adhn/ModelTime_B.csv?dl=1).


### R code for the analysis - simulated data <br />

- The R code for the individual analysis, explained in Section 2 and 3, can be dowloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/l8yy35atibxutmj/AB_total.R?dl=1). This code has been used to generate Figure 6.

- The R code for the pair analysis, explained in Section 2 and in our [SOF](https://ludovicalv.github.io/PDFs/Elep_paper.pdf), can be dowloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b4tb4zqxse8zu7n/Pair_barplot_AB.R?dl=1). This code has been used to generate Figure 7.

- The R code used to plot the pair distance, colored according to the pair behaviour, can be downloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3e9p5lhkm88dxye/Col_distance_AB.R?dl=1). This code has been used to generate Figures 8 and 9.

We used the integrated development environment [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) to perform all the analysis.

### Empirical data: African elephant GPS relocation data <br />

The relocation data for the cow and the bull can be downloaded can be downloaded: [cow](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9tfr4u9hl9xiche/Cow.RData?dl=1), [bull](https://www.dropbox.com/s/csxqswp5nwn8emm/Bull.RData?dl=1)

### R code for the analysis - empirical data <br />

- The R code for the individual analysis can be dowloaded [here]() - TBA (to be added). This code has been used to generate Figure 10.

- The R code for the pair analysis can be dowloaded [here]() - TBA. This code has been used to generate Figure 11. For the season analysis, the R code can be download [here]() - TBA. This code has been used to generate Figure 12.

- The R code for the extended analysis, explained in Section 2 and in our [SOF](https://ludovicalv.github.io/PDFs/Elep_paper.pdf), can be dowloaded [here]() - TBA. This code has been used to generate Figures 15 and 16. The code for the time of the day analysis can be dowloaded [here]() - TBA, while the code for the season analysis can be be dowloaded [here]() - TBA.
