### Numerus Model Builder (NMB) models <br />

To generate the data used in Section 4, we create and run the following NMB models, explained in details in our [SOF](https://ludovicalv.github.io/PDFs/Elep_paper.pdf)

- Distance-dependent behaviour: the model can be downloaded [here]()

- Time-dependent behaviour: the model can be downloaded [here]()

### R code for the analysis  <br />

- The R code for the individual analysis, explained in Section 2 and 3, can be dowloaded [here]()

- The R code for the pair analysis, explained in Section 2 and in our [SOF](https://ludovicalv.github.io/PDFs/Elep_paper.pdf), can be dowloaded [here]()

- The R code for the frequency analysis, explained in Section 2 and in our [SOF](https://ludovicalv.github.io/PDFs/Elep_paper.pdf), can be dowloaded [here]()
