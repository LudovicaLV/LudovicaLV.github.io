#   Supplementary Material
We want to provide the spatio-temporal evolution of the TSTL properties presented in the paper and the MELA models we used to perform stochastic simulations.

## TSTL properties verification

Case study: Defining safety zones
Safe zone without control
Safe zones with control 
High risk zones 

Case study: Emergency evacuation route
Safe exit
Fire spread
